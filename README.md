This project is to build a voice chat bot with a voice recognition to engage customers in natural conversations about menus, specials, and pricing. It should accurately capture order details like pizza type, toppings, and delivery addresses.

By automating order-taking, the staff can focus on the main business such as making pizzas while the bot handles incoming calls efficiently. No more missed orders or misunderstandings.

The bot integrates with phone call providers, speach recognition and text-to-speach services, address validation, and implements the AI agents design. 

Streamline operations and improve customer experience with voice chat bot for pizzerias.
